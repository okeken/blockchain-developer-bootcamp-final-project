The basic idea is to allow people to hodl tokens with a set locked time period. Say you want to be investing in crypto projects no matter how little you want to buy. You will be able to deposit funds into er20 based tokens into your vaults and only be able to withdraw after minimum 3-4 months. You'll be rewarded with the eco system token if you met your goals and penalized if you withdraw too early.
Here's what the workflow looks like, 

1) connect your wallet to dapp 
2) Choose the assets to want to deposit and time and click on deposit and pay the fee
3) Wait till the time your asset is due for deposit and withdraw when it's time
